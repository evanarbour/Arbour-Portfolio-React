            Hi! My name is Evan -- I grew up in
            a small town in Maine where all my family still lives! After college, I started my fitness career
            in NYC and then moved to Seattle in 2017.

            I am completing a Full-Stack Web Developer program through the University of Washington with skills in CSS, HTML,
            JavaScript, and various back-end programs. I am most passionate about the UI/UX design of web applications
            - the mixture of creative vision and technical skills.
